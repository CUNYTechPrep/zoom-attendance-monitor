# Zoom Attendance Monitor

Web application for monitoring zoom webhook events

> [!NOTE]
> This project starter requires Node.js v22.14.0 (LTS) or newer to work properly. The project makes use of features not available in older versions such as ECMAScript/JavaScript modules ([ESM](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/esm.html)), node [watch mode](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html#--watch), and node [env-file support](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html#--env-fileconfig).
>
> LTS ([long-term support](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#nodejs-releases)) versions (v22) of Node.js are recommended for use with this starter.

### Running the app locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For local development you will need three terminals open, one for the backend-api, another for the frontend-client, and one for the ngrok tool.

_Clone_ this app, then:

```bash
# backend-api terminal 1
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# in the .env file update the DATABASE_URL env var with your PostgreSQL connection string
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# frontend-client terminal 2
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- backend-api will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- frontend-client will launch at: http://localhost:5173


### Setting Up Zoom Webhooks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before connecting with Zoom you will need to install the `ngrok` cli tool. See [their download page](https://ngrok.com/downloads/mac-os) for download and
install instructions. You will also need to create an account [on their signup page here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)

1. Set up your ngrok authtoken. You can go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken after creating an account and logging in
and using this command to set it up:
   ```shell
   ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
   ```
2. Start the backend with `npm run dev`
3. Create the http tunnel with ngrok with the command: `ngrok http 8080`. You should see output similar to:
  ```shell
  ngrok

4. Log into the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) with your personal Zoom account
5. After signing in, click on the `Develop` bottom on the top right hand side of the screen (near your profile/account picture)
and select `Build App`
6. In the modal that appears, select `Webhook only App`
7. In the next modal, give this app a name (for this I used `CTP Attendance Monitor`)
8. On the next page, fill out all the details in the form (i.e.: Short description, company name, email, etc.) and click the `Continue` button when you're done
9. In the next screen, you should see a `Secret Token` and a `Verification Token`
   * The `Secret Token` should be saved in the `ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN=` environment in your `.env` file
10. Turn on the `Event Subscriptions` option on the same page and click on the button that says `+ Add Event Subscription`
11. Click on the `+ Add Events` button
   * In the search box, search for `participant` and select the following options:
     * [x] Start Meeting
     * [x] End Meeting
     * [x] Participant/Host joined meeting
     * [x] Participant/Host left meeting
12. In the `Event notification endpoint URL` put the URL from `ngrok` + `/api/webhook`
    * ex: `<ngrok-url>/api/webhook`
    * ex: `https://ed66-87-23-27-181.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook`
13. Click on the `Validate` and make sure that it successfully validates (if you get an error make sure that your backend is 
running [`npm run dev`], that you have the ngrok service running, and that you're using the correct endpoint url)
14. Hit `Save` and `Continue`. You should see the message `Your app is activated on the account` on the following page.


Now create a meeting with the same Zoom account and use another device and join the same meeting. In the terminal for the 
backend you should see different events sent to your server!
