# Zoom Attendance Monitor

Web application for monitoring zoom webhook events

> [!NOTE]
> This project starter requires Node.js v22.14.0 (LTS) or newer to work properly. The project makes use of features not available in older versions such as ECMAScript/JavaScript modules ([ESM](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/esm.html)), node [watch mode](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html#--watch), and node [env-file support](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html#--env-fileconfig).
>
> LTS ([long-term support](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#nodejs-releases)) versions (v22) of Node.js are recommended for use with this starter.

### Running the app locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For local development you will need two terminals open, one for the backend-api and another for the frontend-client.

_Clone_ this app, then:

```bash
# backend-api terminal 1
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# in the .env file update the DATABASE_URL env var with your PostgreSQL connection string
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# frontend-client terminal 2
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- backend-api will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- frontend-client will launch at: http://localhost:5173


### Setting Up Zoom Webhooks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before connecting with Zoom you will need to install the `ngrok` cli tool. See [their download page](https://ngrok.com/downloads/mac-os) for download and
install instructions. You will also need to create an account [on their signup page here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)

1. Set up your ngrok authtoken. You can go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken after creating an account and logging in
and using this command to set it up:
   ```shell
   ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
   ```
2. Start the backend with `npm run dev`
3. Create the http tunnel with ngrok with the command: `ngrok http 8080`. You should see output similar to:
  ```shell
  ngrok
